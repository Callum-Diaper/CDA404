        <h1>Education Information</h1>
        <p>
	    My education regarding IT starts in year 10 where I chose to do computing as one of my GCSE's. I initially struggled to grasp the concepts of programming and some aspects of the course and was even told that I should drop it but I perservered and
 	    eventually scored a passing grade in my GCSEs. After that I went to Fareham College where I studied computing in their new facilities. Here is where I refined my understanding of programming and code by learning mode complex languages such as
	    C and C++ which also helped me understand procedural and object-oriented languages. I made 2 text-based adventure games in C and C++. I then went for another year of college at Highbury college. Here I took a part time course which allowed me
	    to work and study at the same time in preperation for university while also helping me understand more about computing as a whole. I achieved a passing grade in both Fareham and Highbury. Now I am attending Solent University and taking a 
	    Business and IT course which will help me understand the real life applications of IT in the modern business world.
