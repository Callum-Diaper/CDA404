    <h2>Job Experience</h2>
    <p> I do have little bits of experience within the IT industry due to work experience I undertook in college. During that work experience, I was lucky enough to work with HM Coastguard at the National Maritime Operations Centre where I helped check
	inventory, update old spreadsheets, dismantle old computers and sort through old computers for functioning parts. This work experience was good but had the drawback that I could not interact with any of the main IT systems as I was only a 
	temporary worker. Another bit of work experience I have had in the IT industry would be when I did work experience at Ocean Trading (now closed). I helped out program touch screen registers while also helping out with clearing the warehouse.
	These bits of work experience aren't very IT based but they did give me some window into what happens in different aspects in the industry. 

	I have also been to college where I studied computing. I have also been learning to code since Year 10 where I started with Python. Since then I have been taught the basics of programming in procedural and object-oriented languages such as
	Python, C, C++ ,and more recently, Javascript. Below you will see an example of basic Javascript.
