## Introduction
This project will be using multiple programming languages to help create a webpage that is fully functional. This webpage is to help bring to
light and help solve a problem in the real world. In my project, I will be creating a personal portfolio with my details and previous experiences
to help me with the problem of self-promotion. The website will achieve this by making my previous education and work experience known to 
users that read it. These users would hopefully be employers that would want to hire me.

## Wireframes
Wireframes are an integral part of website design. This is because they allow you to plan out how you want your website to look and how they
will function on different devices and resolutions. Wireframes are also helpful because you can plan out exactly where you want each individual
aspect of your webpage before you start messing with the HTML and CSS. You also have to make different wireframes for desktop and mobile devices
because of the difference in screen size. Below you will see examples of a website wireframe for both desktop and mobile.

## Colour choices
The colour used for this website is blue for the header/footer and white for the main page background. The blue colour was chosen because of its
association with professionalism. You can see this in most modern tech companies where they use blue as their primary colour for their logos
and marketing. The specific hex value used for the website I created would be #3944BC. 

## Accessibility
This website does not meet the W3C standards because there is not code on the website that reads text, colours, pictures or the descriptions.
Alternatively most modern browsers are able to provide services to those with hearing or visal disabilities. This is mainly done through
text-to-speach applications which can read the text on screen to someone or applications that allow you to zoom in on the screen.

## GDPR
The Data Protection Act of 1998 is a law that was passed initially in 1995 and was later changed in 1998. The primary objective of this act was to help
protect private data/information. The act itself is comprised of 3 rights and 8 principles. Here they are listed.
The 3 Data rights:
- Have the right to view or have a copy of what data is stored about them.
- Have the right to object if the data stored has caused or will cause distress.
- Have the right to prevent data being processed for direct marketing.

The 8 Principals of data:
- Be processed fairly and lawfully
- Be obtained for lawful purposes
- Be adequate and relevant to the purpose of being stored
- Be kept accurate and up to date
- Not be kept for any longer than necessary
- Be processed within the principles of this act
- Be kept safe and secure
- Be shared only with countries with adequate data protection laws

There is also a few jobs where they have to be exempt from aspects of the act for them to perform their job optimally. These jobs being the police, MI5/MI6, the tax office.

## Evaluation
In conclusion, this website does fill the role of a portfolio and fixes the "problem" of self promotion. This website does meet the criteria of solving a problem and meets the minimum requirements
of 4 webpages. While it does meet these requirements, the information page and the experiences page do have a lot of overlap in information which would
mean that a bit of what's written isn't necessary.
